This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict apartment prices in Daegu, South Korea. As a bustling city known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and economic significance, Daegu attracts residents and investors alike. However, pricing apartments in such a dynamic market can be challenging for sellers and agents.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate apartment prices based on various features and amenities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide a tool that can assist sellers and agents in setting optimal pricing rates for their properties.

The dataset used for this project contains information on various features and amenities of apartments in Daegu, including:

- Size of the apartment
- Number of facilities in each apartment unit
- Presence of facilities such as parking lots, schools, and parks
- Proximity to transportation hubs and amenities

The methodology are as follows: <br>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Selection: Evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing model for price prediction.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a tool for sellers and agents to estimate apartment prices.
